                We'll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be
                seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the
                stars to travel by.

              <h2>Evolution</h2>
              <p>
                For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with
                the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did
                we get here?

              <p>
                Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
                framework for exploring and understanding our place in this
                world.
              </p>

                Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species
                we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time
                to meet a few of the creatures who didn't survive, including our
                Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

              <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
              <p>
                From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
                biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders
                of the tiny world.

                For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
                quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
                understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore
                the history of medicine and take a look at some major
                breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the
                first heart transplant. Many of our great medicinal discoveries
                have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals
                in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

              As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
